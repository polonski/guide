# Spider-Gazelle

> An elegant web framework designed to be simple, powerful and fast.

Spider-Gazelle builds on the amazing performance of [**router.cr**](https://github.com/tbrand/which_is_the_fastest).:rocket:, making it one of the fastest web frameworks.
This is achieved by making heavy use of [Macros](https://crystal-lang.org/docs/syntax_and_semantics/macros.html) to preprocess and inline as much as possible before compile time.

It also looks and feels a lot like [Rails](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/) with a few minor improvements thanks to [Crystal lang](https://crystal-lang.org/)


## Who builds it?
